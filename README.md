Blockchain Voting System

In order to run the application, it needs to be hosted on a server.

I have used 'http-server' package via Node.js's npm.


In order to setup Node.js and npm for running the voting system, follow the next steps:

1. Download Node.js (npm is included with Node.js) from here: https://nodejs.dev/en/download/

2. Open a command prompt

3. Type "npm install -g http-server". This will install 'http-server' globally on your system.

4. "cd" to the folder location where the html, css and javascript files are located.

5. Type "http-server" and hit enter.

6. Use one of the displayed links to access the application.


Make sure to follow the steps in the documentation located at chapter 7, "User Manual", page 32 to setup MetaMask and run the app.
